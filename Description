Results of Stroke Prediction with Varying Deep Learning Models..........................................................................................................................

The performance of three classifiers—KNN, Random Forest, and XGBooster—was evaluated under baseline and hypertuned conditions for stroke prediction. 
The results reveal varying strengths and highlight the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.

Baseline Performance:

Training Accuracy:

KNN Classifier: 96%

Random Forest Classifier: 100% (indicating slight overfitting)

XGBooster: 96%

Testing Accuracy:

KNN Classifier: 94%

Random Forest Classifier: 94%

XGBooster: 96%

Hypertuned Performance:

Training Accuracy: All models achieved 96%, showing improved balance and addressing overfitting in the Random Forest Classifier.

Insights:

XGBooster: Provided slightly better accuracy in baseline testing, demonstrating its robustness in handling complex datasets.

Random Forest Classifier: Initially exhibited overfitting with 100% training accuracy, but hyperparameter tuning improved its generalization, 
achieving consistent results across training and testing datasets.

KNN Classifier: Performance remained unchanged after hypertuning, indicating a potential ceiling in its predictive capabilities with the given data.

Conclusion:
XGBooster emerged as the most effective model for this stroke prediction task, offering a slight edge in baseline accuracy. 
Random Forest and KNN provided competitive performance but required different levels of tuning to address limitations. 
This comparative analysis underscores the importance of model selection and optimization in achieving reliable predictive outcomes in healthcare applications.
